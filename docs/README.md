# Introduction

Welcome to Gödel, a powerful AI agent framework with autonomous tool execution, GitHub integration, auto-testing, and remote access capabilities.

Gödel is an intelligent coding assistant that can read, write, and execute code, manage your GitHub workflow, generate tests, and be controlled remotely from anywhere. Built for developers who need an AI that actually gets work done.

## What is Gödel?

Gödel is a production-ready AI agent framework that combines:

- **Autonomous Tool Execution** - 16+ built-in tools for file operations, shell commands, GitHub API, web search, and more

## Why Gödel?

Named after Kurt Gödel, the mathematician who proved that within any consistent formal system, there are statements that cannot be proven true or false using the rules of that system. Similarly, this agent operates with a degree of autonomy while remaining grounded in explicit tool execution and human oversight.
